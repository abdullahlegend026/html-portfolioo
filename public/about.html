<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a passionate and self-motivated web developer currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science. During my summer break, I decided to dive deep into Full Stack Web Development â€” from crafting elegant front-end designs to building powerful back-end systems. I'm constantly learning and building real-world projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
I enjoy problem-solving, creating clean user experiences, and turning ideas into interactive digital solutions. My goal is to become a skilled developer who not only writes functional code but also delivers value through design and innovation.</p>
